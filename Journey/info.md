# Journey
My journey through competitive programming problems.\
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\
Similarly a journey of a thousand contests begins with a single task.

## Language standard
I use C++17. I compile source codes with `g++ -o sth.bin sth.cpp -std=c++17 -O3 -static -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic`.

## Progress
As of 27 September 2023, I solve [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) tasks rated [1700-2000](https://codeforces.com/problemset?tags=1700-2000).\
Solved tasks
- [Sum of XOR Functions](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1879/D), [sum.cpp](sum_of_xor_functions/sum.cpp), 2023-09-27
- [Mad City](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1873/H), [mad.cpp](mad_city/mad.cpp), 2023-09-28
