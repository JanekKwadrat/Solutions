# Supersonic
I am trying to solve competitive programming problems as fast as possible.\
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed.\
Maybe not lyrics but lines of code.

## Compilation
If you want to go fast you can use the commands `g++ sth.cpp` and `./a.out`.

## Updates
As of 1 October 2023, I solve [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) tasks rated [1300-1600](https://codeforces.com/problemset?tags=1300-1600).

## Progress
